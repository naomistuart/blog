## The Basics


## Calls

| Call | By | Hand Signal | Meaning |
|-|-|-|-|
| `Rider(s) back` | Overtaking rider |  | Advise another rider you are overtaking, when approaching from behind |
| `Rider(s) right` | Overtaking rider |  | Advise another rider you are overtaking, when passing them |
| `On your left/ right` | Regrouping rider |  | Advise your riding partner you are rejoining on the left/right |
| `All on` | Last rider rejoining group<br>(e.g. at top of hill) |  | Advise lead riders that peloton has fully regrouped, so they can resume normal pace |
| `[Hazard] left/ middle/ right`<br>(e.g. "Hole left", "Stick middle", "Glass right") | Lead riders | Hand pointed towards hazard | Alert peloton to hazards on the road |
| `Door` | Lead riders | Left hand placed behind back<br>(indicates riders behind should move across and away from hazard) | Alert peloton to risk of car door opening |
| `[Moving thing] up`<br>(e.g. "Car up", "Walker up", "Runner Up", "Riders Up") | Lead riders | Left hand placed behind back<br>(indicates riders behind should move across and away from hazard) | Alert peloton to vehicles, pedestrians, joggers or cyclists ahead of the bunch |
| `Lights, stopping` | Lead riders | One hand held up | Signal peloton to stop for a red traffic light |
| `Rolling` | Lead riders |  | Signal peloton to continue moving, since there is not sufficient space to stop in time and it is safe to continue through traffic lights |
| `Stopping` | Lead riders,<br>or Middle/ rear riders (only in a large peloton with more than 12 riders) |  | Signal peloton to stop at a traffic light, roundabout or intersection. In a large peloton, the call can be made by middle or rear riders, in which case the peloton will split and regroup later |
| `Clear` | Lead riders |  | Signal peloton to continue through a roundabout or intersection |
| `Hold the lane` | Lead riders |  | Remind riders to keep to their lane in a roundabout |
| `Single` | Lead or rear riders | One hand raised above the helmet, pointing forward | Signal peloton to move into single file formation (e.g. when the road narrows or traffic increases, or rear rider anticipates congestion behind the peloton) |
| `Wait` | Rear riders |  | Indicate to lead riders it is not yet safe to change lanes |
| `Over` | Rear riders |  | Indicate to lead riders it is safe to change lanes |
| `Car back` | Rear riders |  | Alert peloton to vehicle approaching from behind; signals riders to move over to the left, or move to single file if the road is too narrow |
| `Car inside`<br>(NOT "Car left") | Rear riders |  | Alert peloton to vehicle passing on the inside lane (when the peloton is in a righthand lane) |
| `Mechanical` | Rider requiring mechanical repairs |  | Signal to peloton you are stopping off the road for mechanical repairs |
