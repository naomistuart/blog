I put off signing up to the Tour de Cure for a long time because I had no idea how to choose a bike. My knowledge of the different components of a bike and the pros and cons of various configurations was basically non-existent.

This is the journey I went on from being bike-less[^1] to a happy owner of my very first road bike.

## Word-of-Mouth

Many of my colleagues are Tour de Cure veterans. Once they found out I was interested in joining the Tour, they practically sent me essays on Teams advising me on many things bike-related, from brands to consider and shops to visit through to a breakdown of the different bike components to research.

This allowed me to start narrowing down, at the highest level, the type of bike to look for:

- Must have drop handlebars, not flat bars (I had no idea of the difference until I did a quick google)
- A price range of $1500-2000 was reasonable for an entry-level road bike
- Shimano 105 came up in every conversation I had.


## Research

Afterwards, I spent a few hours reading articles online and watching YouTube videos to learn more about the key components of a road bike:

- **Frame**: The lighter the better. Entry level bike frames are usually aluminum, while higher-end models are typically carbon fibre, which is lighter. Frames come in different sizes, e.g. XSmall/48cm or Small/50cm, and different brands can have slightly different sizing. Frames can also be differentiated by their geometry - performance or race bikes have a more aggressive profile for improved aerodynamics, while endurance bikes allow a more upright riding position, which makes long distance rides more comfortable.

- **Brakes**: A choice between rim brakes or disc brakes. Rim brakes are more traditional, and work by applying the braking force on the outer edge (i.e. rim) of the wheel. Disc brakes, in contrast, use a rotor to apply braking force towards the centre of the wheel. Disc brakes are increasingly popular on road bikes, since they have better stopping power than rim brakes, especially in wet weather. However, they also tend to be heavier and more expensive.

- **Gears**: These are encapsulated within a road bike's _groupset_, which is the collection of components involved in braking, changing gears and running of the drivetrain. Shimano is the most popular brand for groupsets, and they produce a hierarchy of models with increasing price and performance. Shimano Tiagra, a 10-speed groupset, is used on many entry-level road bikes. The next level up, Shimano 105, a 11-speed groupset, was consistently recommended to me as a good intermediate-level choice sufficient for the demands of a Tour de Cure. The next levels up are the Shimano Ultegra and Shimano Dura-Ace, which are targeted at high-level and professional riders.


## Shopping

- Information disparity
- Some brands, shops to look out for
- 99 bikes - took my measurements, tried out XS and s, then cube attain SL
- Asked whether I had ever ridden a road bike, I said no, they just let me go for it
- First impressions - stooped low, leaning forward, seat super high, felt I was battling a beast, riding a rhino, quite scary especially since my feet did not touch the ground
- Allowed me to just take the bike for a spin, nearby park, no questions asked
- Recommended cube attain - Shimano 105 + disc brakes
- Everyone recommended Shimano 105 - not much use since I didnâ€™t even know how to change gears
- Bike shops - went to 5, and not one had a single woman staff member I could see
- TREK store - no bike under $3k, though guy was very helpful in talking me through all the peripheries
- Chain Reaction store - this time the guy followed me out to a deserted parking lot (creepy), then watched me as I attempted to ride, needless to say it was unnerving
- Covid times - narrowed down my choices considerably (news article link)
- Gave colleagues a list and hear their thoughts
- Bike fitting
- paradox of choice was alleviated by covid, multiple staff suggested the second hand market, but I did not want to dip into that as I didn't really what I was looking at, and did not want to run the risk of being ripped off.

[^1]: I did have a bike before but a $60 one I got off Gumtree hardly counts.
