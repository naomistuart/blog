Hi, I'm Naomi.

In March 2021 I will take part in [Westpac Move for a Cure](https://moveforacure.com.au/) - a 3-day, 356km ride from Forster to Sydney - to raise funds for cancer research, support and prevention projects.

I am completely new to road biking. This is my personal blog to document my journey, reflections and learnings.
